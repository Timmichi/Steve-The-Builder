## Project Summary
Steve the Builder is a project focused on exploring the ways machine learning can be used to control a bot in Minecraft whose main defense against opposing creatures is simply building. The goal is to have the bot create a shelter for itself against different types of enemies and in different kinds of terrains.

## Approach
Since the first enemy we tested, the "Ghast", only shoots a harmful projectile to the agent every 4~6 seconds, it was evident that some kind of delayed reinforcement learning algorithm would be appropriate. 
## Evaluation
time reward increase over time
qualitative: seeing agent build to avoid enemies
## Remaining Goals and Challenges

## Resources Used
assignment2 was used as the base or starting point for this project.
